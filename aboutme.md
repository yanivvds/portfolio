# 👋 About Yaniv van der Stigchel

## 🚀 Mission
I’m **Yaniv van der Stigchel**, a Bachelor’s student in **Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam** with a minor in **Managing Digital Innovation** at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  
My mission is simple: to bridge **AI and business strategy** by turning innovative ideas into practical, data-driven systems that create measurable impact.

I’m passionate about building intelligent products that make technology more **useful, human, and scalable** — whether that means designing AI-powered dashboards, predictive recruitment tools, or conversational assistants that redefine user experience.

---

## 🧠 What Drives Me
At the core of my work lies **creativity and curiosity** — two things that constantly push me to explore how technology can be applied in unconventional yet effective ways.  
I love **turning abstract ideas into systems that make a measurable difference**, whether that’s through automation, data visualization, or applied machine learning.

I approach every project as both a **creative challenge** and a **strategic exercise**: understanding the business context, identifying technical opportunities, and crafting solutions that work not just in theory, but in practice.

---

## 💼 Professional Focus
I thrive in environments where technology, strategy, and creativity intersect — particularly in **AI product development**, **data-driven software engineering**, and **innovation-focused teams**.

I’m most drawn to **product-building roles** within **tech-driven companies** such as **Booking.com, Adyen, Uber, or KLM**, where AI is used to shape smarter business processes, optimize user experiences, or unlock new market opportunities.

As a **strategic thinker** and **creative problem solver**, I’m especially passionate about:
- Translating complex AI or data concepts into clear business value  
- Building **AI-integrated MVPs** and experimenting rapidly with new ideas  
- Collaborating with cross-functional teams to align technology with real-world impact  
- Applying modern full-stack and data architectures to deliver scalable, intelligent systems

## 🌍 Vision & Next Steps
After completing my Bachelor’s, I plan to either:
- Pursue a **Master’s in Artificial Intelligence**, deepening my focus on cognitive systems and applied machine learning, **or**
- Join a **graduate program or innovation-driven tech company** that allows me to contribute to AI-integrated products from day one.

I’m currently **open to thesis internships, graduate roles, and freelance collaborations**, particularly in AI-driven SaaS, product innovation, or applied data science environments.

**Preferred location:** Amsterdam / Randstad (flexible to relocate)  
**Work mode:** Hybrid or on-site preferred for strong team collaboration  

---

## 🤝 Values & Work Ethic
I believe that **reliability, integrity, and curiosity** are as important as technical skill.  
I take pride in being someone who not only builds, but also communicates — bridging the gap between developers, designers, and business stakeholders.

My goal is to always bring clarity and creativity into teams, whether by designing an efficient backend pipeline, crafting a meaningful UX, or identifying opportunities to make an AI feature truly valuable for users.

---

## 🌱 Beyond Work
Outside of coding, I find creativity in photography, travel, and design — often combining those interests with technology projects.  
I love exploring new cultures, experimenting with side projects (like AI-based platform for restaurants or content creators - TagJeTafel), and occasionally flying my **DJI Mini 2 drone** to capture new perspectives — literally.
