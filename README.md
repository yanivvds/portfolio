## Deployment

You can choose your preferred service (e.g., [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Render](https://render.com/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)) for deployment. One of the easiest ways to host this portfolio is using GitHub Pages. Follow the instructions below for a production deploy.

1. **Set Up GitHub Repository**

    Create a new repository on GitHub for your portfolio app.

2. **Configure `package.json`**

    Edit the following properties in your `package.json` file:

    ```json
    {
        "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name",
        "scripts": {
            "predeploy": "npm run build",
            "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
            ...
        }
    }
    ```

    Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username and `your-repo-name` with the name of your GitHub repository.
